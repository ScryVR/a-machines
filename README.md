# A-Frame Machines

This repository provides an aframe component called `a-machine` which makes it easy to build interactive objects in virtual reality, often in a no-code manner.
These machine components can listen for events from each other or the user, can emit events, or update some internal state. This allows them to achieve very complex behavior.
While defining custom machines is supported and encouraged, a number of prebuilt machines are provided to enable a lot of functionality without knowing anything about programming.
